This is different to Link active build with POB.&#10;- - Link will simply link the PoL build with a PoB pastebin, that you can view in Poebuddy&#10;or keep a reference too.&#10;- - With this new function, you can paste your PoB pastebin, and the app will automatically&#10;create a snapshot of the PoB build. All socket groups will be created, and all gems will&#10;get assigned. You can then edit the build normally to add transitions and replacements, or make&#10;your own additions/removals, as always.  After saving the build it can be used as all others and&#10;exported to Pastebin and shared.&#10;- Added validation functionality.&#10;- -  Now when you have a build that has some kind of error, you can choose to ignore it&#10; by making the build non validated. This will add a light gray background color on your build banner on the right &#10;column, where your builds are listed. Then you can go back to the launcher without having to resolve the issue&#10; but you will not be able to select this build as your leveling guide.&#10;- - This introduced a visual bug, where if you change the until group level slider to a non - valid position, (meaning&#10; you chose to replace a group at level 31 but the socket group becomes available at 38 f.i.) ,&#10;and then you switch builds in the editor and back to the original build, the slider will show the (correct) value.&#10; - Added a confirmation dialogue when exiting the editor window.&#10; If you cancel any changes you made will not be saved.&#10; - Started an implementation of gem tags. That will make possible in the future for gem sorting and other nice&#10; features.&#10;- Added crafting recipes. You can enable/disable them in the settings menu.&#10;- - Upon entering an area you get an icon (simillar to trial,passive) that indicates zone contains a recipe to find.&#10;- - Assign a keybind to Mark Recipe. Pressing the button will mark the recipe as found&#10; and later you can revisit in a seperate window and check which recipes you missed during leveling.&#10;&#10; __Reddit requests__&#10;- Your overlay positions will now persist between app restarts.&#10;- When you create a new gem group it should automatically bring up the attached window.&#10;- Auto-select the first non-support gem entered for each group as the default main gem, user can change later.&#10;&#10; __Bug fixes__&#10;- Fixed a bug with images in Dried Lake and Aqueduct in Act 4. &#10; &#10; __Changes__&#10;- Gem selection panel has been improved by &quot;Protuhj&quot;. You can search for gems with an auto-completion box and&#10;auto scrolling when choosing the gem. (possible improvements in the future)&#10;- Gem overlay has been moved to the left side of the screen, to prevent overlapping with an open inventory.&#10;If you have a suggestion about default positions please let me know.&#10;- Character name is no longer case sensitive.&#10;- When updating to new version you get a confirmation dialogue." />
